A project by Komal Jain <br>
<br>
Medium: Online comic/zine, collage art, poetry, lorem ipsum <br>
Reading Time: 10 minutes <br>
Size: Variable, as per viewing screen <br>
Year of Production: 2021-2022 <br>
<br>
The graphic narrative is based on the article, Why are Mammals called Mammals? Gender Politics in Eighteenth Century Natural History by Dr.Londa Schiebinger. It talks about how the classification of mammals and inclusion of humans in the class is influenced by the gender politics of that time. Having not had a chance to study textbooks in school with a critical eye, reading the article was an eye-opening experience for me. The motivation is not to question science but rather to look back at the relations between science, society and politics. I hope this project leads to a public dialogue as to why the name still exists post Darwinian revolution, as suggested by Dr. Schiebinger and collective questioning to bring a change. <br> <br>

For storytelling purposes, wherever required, places and time have been blurred and additional references are made, keeping the historical accuracy of ideas and thoughts intact. <br> <br>
